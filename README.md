## 👨‍💻 Who Made This?

This entire project was built and maintained **solo** by just **one person** using a **single laptop powered by a humble Pentium processor** 🥲.  

Everything — from coding the site, collecting files, organizing data, to manually updating the archive — is done by hand. So if your uploaded file doesn’t appear instantly, **please be patient**, it might take a little time 🙏

I’m doing my best to keep this place running smooth and helpful for everyone ❤️
